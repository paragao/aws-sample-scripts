# Objective

This repository has the objective of compiling a series of small projects that I have worked on for customers and friends. Most of them will be interacting with the AWS services. 

# Projects

## List of contents
### Delete Amazon S3 buckets which are not empty
Buckets can only be deleted if they are empty. This script will iterate through all objects and delete them. 

### Tracing Python applications using AWS XRay
Observability is important to identify possible performance bottleneck, improve customer experience, and identify problems/errors in your applications.
