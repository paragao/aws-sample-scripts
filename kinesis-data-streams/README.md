# WIP 
# Data ingestion and processing using Amazon Kinesis

This sample application was created in two different programming languages. You can find the Python version [here](./python/README.md) and the NodeJS version [here]. 

The purpose of the application is the same: to ingest streaming data into a database and a data lake at the same time, with low latency and high throughput.
