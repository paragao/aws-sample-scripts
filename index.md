# Samples AWS scripts to make your cloud journey easier

This repository has the objective of compiling a series of small projects that I have worked on for customers and friends. Most of them will be interacting with the AWS services. 

List of projects is ever increasing and includes:
 - Delete Amazon S3 buckets which are not empty
 - Frontend that allows to upload/download files from Amazon S3
 - Implement tracing on python/nodejs applications using AWS XRay
 - Managing costs and resources using tags

## List of projects

These are the projects you can find in this repository. Instructions on how to implement those projects are provided in each of their specific folders. More details about the architecture and technologies used on those projects will be provided in the sections below.
